###Meet Our Founder

Jason Mosley is a new media designer living in the city of Pittsburgh. He has created websites ever since he had a computer and the Internet. Being obsessed about technology, you can often find him reading a tech blog or working his next big idea.

When he is not cranking out killer designs, you can always find him updating one of his many web projects. The one that consumes most of his free time is MrBaconpants, a personal blog where he talks about his love for all things bacon. Another web project of his worth mentioning is Startup Pittsburgh, a blog/job board covering the local startup community. He has also done freelance blogging/writing for Crunch Gear, Mobile Crunch, and Touch Arcade.
