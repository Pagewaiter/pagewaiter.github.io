# Pagewaiter

[Pagewaiter](http://pagewaiter.github.io/) is the frontend develpment blog and portfolio if Jason Mosley. It is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site based off the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. I made a few modifications to make the site work the way I want it.

# Pull Requests are Welcome.
